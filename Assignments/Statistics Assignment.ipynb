    "It is important to understand the level of measurement when analyzing data because different statistical analyses can be used for different types of data. Using the wrong statistical analysis can result in incorrect conclusions and potentially misleading results.\n",

    "For example, suppose we are interested in comparing the heights of students in a class based on their gender. We measure the height of each student and record their gender as either male or female. In this case, height is a variable measured at the interval level, and gender is a variable measured at the nominal level.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to use a t-test to compare the mean heights of males and females in the class, we would be making a mistake. This is because a t-test assumes that the data being compared is measured at the interval level. Instead, we should use a non-parametric test, such as the Mann-Whitney U test, which is appropriate for comparing groups based on ordinal or nominal data.\n",

    "Ans:- MongoDB is a popular document-oriented NoSQL database that allows for flexible and scalable storage of data in JSON-like documents. MongoDB uses a dynamic schema, which means that documents in a collection can have different fields and structures, allowing for easier evolution of data models over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, or NoSQL databases, are databases that do not use the traditional tabular relations used by relational databases like SQL. Instead, NoSQL databases use different data models to store and manage data, including document-oriented, key-value, graph, and column-family databases. NoSQL databases are often preferred for their ability to handle large volumes of data, their ability to scale horizontally, and their ability to provide high availability and fault tolerance.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where the data model is not well-defined, and the structure of the data may evolve over time. Additionally, MongoDB is well-suited for applications that require high scalability and performance, as it can distribute data across many nodes in a cluster. MongoDB is also a good choice for applications that handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data, such as social media, mobile, and IoT applications.\n",

    "Ans:-MongoDB is a document-oriented NoSQL database that has a number of features that make it popular among developers and organizations. Some of the key features of MongoDB are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Flexible data model: MongoDB has a dynamic schema, which means that documents in a collection can have different structures and fields. This allows for greater flexibility in the data model and makes it easier to evolve the schema as the application requirements change.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Scalability: MongoDB is designed to scale horizontally across many nodes, allowing it to handle large volumes of data and high traffic loads. This makes it a good choice for applications that require high scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.High availability: MongoDB supports replication and automatic failover, ensuring that data is always available even in the event of a node failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Indexing: MongoDB supports indexing of fields in documents, which makes it possible to query data quickly and efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.Aggregation framework: MongoDB includes a powerful aggregation framework that allows for complex queries and data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.Ad hoc queries: MongoDB supports ad hoc queries, which means that developers can easily query the database without having to define a schema or structure beforehand.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.Support for geospatial data: MongoDB includes support for geospatial data, making it a good choice for applications that need to work with location-based data.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.Document validation: MongoDB includes a feature for document validation, which allows developers to enforce rules on the structure and content of documents in a collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, MongoDB's features make it a popular choice for developers and organizations that require a flexible and scalable database that can handle large volumes of data and high traffic loads."

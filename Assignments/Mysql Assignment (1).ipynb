    "A database is a collection of organized data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. It is used to store and retrieve data in a structured way, making it easy to search and filter information.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL and NoSQL are two different types of databases that are used for different purposes. SQL, or Structured Query Language, databases are relational databases that store data in tables that have predefined relationships between them. They are used for applications that require complex queries and transactions, such as financial systems, online stores, and inventory management systems. SQL databases are characterized by their strong data consistency, ability to scale vertically, and transactional capability.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are non-relational databases that store data in a flexible, unstructured format, such as documents, key-value pairs, or graphs. They are designed for handling large volumes of unstructured data, such as social media content, sensor data, and logs. NoSQL databases are characterized by their ability to scale horizontally, their high availability, and their ability to handle data of various structures and types.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, SQL databases are relational and provide strong consistency and transactional capability, while NoSQL databases are non-relational and provide flexibility, scalability, and high availability for handling large volumes of unstructured data. The choice between SQL and NoSQL databases depends on the specific needs of the application and the type of data being stored."

    "\n",
    "The following are some commonly used DDL commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.CREATE: This command is used to create a new database object, such as a table, view, or index. For example, the following SQL statement creates a new table named \"customers\":\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE customers (\n",
    "    id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,\n",
    "    email VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE,\n",
    "    phone VARCHAR(20)\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "2.DROP: This command is used to delete an existing database object, such as a table or index. For example, the following SQL statement drops the \"customers\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "DROP TABLE customers;\n",
    "\n",
    "3.ALTER: This command is used to modify the structure of an existing database object, such as adding or deleting columns in a table. For example, the following SQL statement adds a new column named \"address\" to the \"customers\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER TABLE customers\n",
    "ADD COLUMN address VARCHAR(100);\n",
    "\n",
    "4.TRUNCATE: This command is used to delete all data from an existing table, while keeping the table structure intact. For example, the following SQL statement deletes all data from the \"customers\" table:\n",
    "\n",
    "TRUNCATE TABLE customers;\n"

    "SET email = 'newemail@example.com'\n",
    "WHERE customer_id = 1;\n",

    "Ans:-DQL stands for Data Query Language. It is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used to query and retrieve data from a relational database.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main command in DQL is SELECT. Here's an explanation of SELECT with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT: This command is used to retrieve data from one or more tables in a database. The syntax for SELECT is as follows:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    SELECT column1, column2, ...\n",
    "FROM table_name\n",
    "WHERE condition;\n",
    "###############\n",

    "FROM students\n",

    "\n",
    "This will retrieve the \"first_name\", \"last_name\", and \"email\" columns for all rows in the \"students\" table where the \"grade\" is equal to \"A\".\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also use other SQL functions with SELECT to perform more complex operations on the data, such as sorting, grouping, and aggregating. Here's an example that sorts the results by last name in descending order:\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT first_name, last_name, email\n",
    "FROM students\n",
    "WHERE grade = 'A'\n",
    "ORDER BY last_name DESC;\n",
    "\n",
    "This will retrieve the same data as before, but the results will be sorted by last name in descending order.\n",

    "Ans:-Primary Key and Foreign Key are both important concepts in relational databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "A primary key is a column or set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row in that table. Primary keys are used to enforce data integrity and ensure that there are no duplicate rows in the table. They are also used to create relationships between tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say we have a table called \"customers\" with columns \"customer_id\", \"first_name\", \"last_name\", and \"email\". We can make the \"customer_id\" column the primary key by adding a constraint to the table definition like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE customers (\n",
    "  customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "  first_name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "  last_name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "  email VARCHAR(100)\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "This will ensure that every row in the \"customers\" table has a unique \"customer_id\" value.\n",
    "\n",
    "A foreign key, on the other hand, is a column or set of columns in a table that references the primary key of another table. Foreign keys are used to create relationships between tables and enforce referential integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say we have another table called \"orders\" with columns \"order_id\", \"customer_id\", \"order_date\", and \"total_amount\". We can create a foreign key constraint on the \"customer_id\" column to reference the \"customer_id\" column in the \"customers\" table like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE orders (\n",
    "  order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "  customer_id INT,\n",
    "  order_date DATE,\n",
    "  total_amount DECIMAL(10,2),\n",
    "  FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "This will ensure that every value in the \"customer_id\" column of the \"orders\" table corresponds to a valid \"customer_id\" value in the \"customers\" table. If a row is deleted from the \"customers\" table, any rows in the \"orders\" table that reference that customer will be automatically deleted or set to null (depending on the specific database configuration).\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, a primary key uniquely identifies each row in a table, while a foreign key creates a relationship between tables by referencing the primary key of another table. Both primary keys and foreign keys are important for enforcing data integrity and maintaining the consistency of relational databases.\n"

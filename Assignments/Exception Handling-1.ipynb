    "In Python, an exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program. When an exception occurs, the normal flow of the program is disrupted, and Python raises an exception object. An exception object contains information about the error, such as its type and message, and can be handled using exception handling mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between exceptions and syntax errors is that syntax errors occur when the Python interpreter is unable to understand the code due to a mistake in its syntax, such as a missing colon or parentheses. Syntax errors prevent the program from running at all, whereas exceptions occur during the execution of a program and can be handled using exception handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions can be broadly categorized into two types: built-in exceptions and user-defined exceptions. Built-in exceptions are the ones that are provided by Python itself, such as TypeError, ValueError, and ZeroDivisionError. User-defined exceptions are exceptions that are defined by the user and can be used to handle specific errors in a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some common built-in exceptions in Python include:\n",
    "\n",
    "TypeError: raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of inappropriate type\n",
    "ValueError: raised when a built-in operation or function receives an argument that has the right type but an inappropriate value\n",
    "ZeroDivisionError: raised when the second argument of a division or modulo operation is zero\n",
    "IndexError: raised when an index is out of range\n",
    "In summary, exceptions are errors that occur during the execution of a program, and they can be handled using exception handling mechanisms. They are different from syntax errors, which occur due to mistakes in the syntax of the program and prevent the program from running at all. Python provides built-in exceptions for common error scenarios, and users can also define their own exceptions to handle specific errors."
